      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello, my name is Liam — welcome to my digital portfolio. I’m a 15-year-old high school student currently enrolled at Woodlawn High School. I consistently achieve strong academic results, with most of my grades falling between 92% and 95%, although gym is a surprising outlier given my enthusiasm for sports.
      </p>
      <p>
        Football is my greatest passion. For me, it’s more than just a sport — it’s a source of peace and motivation. Whether I’m on the field or watching a game, football gives me a sense of purpose and energy. I’ve been a fan of the Pittsburgh Steelers since I was young, and I especially admire Antonio Brown and the dynamic style of football from the 2010s.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like many, I dream big — one of my goals is to one day make it to the NFL. While that dream may be ambitious, I’m also focused on more grounded aspirations. I plan to pursue a career in the trades and build a successful business in Canada, where I can work hard and provide for my future family.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of school and sports, I dedicate time to working out 3–4 times a week, following a personalized training split. I highly recommend fitness to anyone looking to boost their confidence and health. I’m also a fan of classic action movies, with the Die Hard series ranking at the top of my favorites.
